        "YOLOv5 is a popular version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and image segmentation model, released on November 22, 2022 by Ultralytics. The YOLOv5 model is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks. It can be trained on large datasets and is capable of running on a variety of hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.\n",
